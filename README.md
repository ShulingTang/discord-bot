## Features

- Forwards text and media from multiple Telegram channels.
- Converts Telegram's Markdown links to plain URLs for better readability on Discord.
- Filters messages containing keywords like "ç©ºæŠ•" (airdrop) and forwards them to a dedicated airdrop channel.
- Filters messages about new perpetual contract listings and forwards them to a dedicated trading channel.
- Forwards the filtered (airdrop/trade) messages to a specified Telegram group.
- Handles large files by notifying about the failure instead of crashing.
- Provides clear logging for monitoring and debugging.
-  Scrapes Gate.io official announcements and posts filtered results to Discord.
- Filters announcements by keyword list (e.g., "gate alpha", "xstocks", "launchpool").
- Supports proxy settings for accessing Gate.io with Selenium.
- Avoids duplicate posts using a local cache file.
- Only posts during specified hours (e.g., 08:00 to 24:00).

# Optional: Special channels for filtered messages

DISCORD_TRADE_CHANNEL_ID=your_trade_discord_channel_id

# Optional: Telegram group to forward filtered messages
DESTINATION_TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID=your_telegram_group_id

# Optional: Path to save the telethon session file
# Defaults to the current directory if not set
SESSION_PATH=/path/to/your/session/folder

# Gate announcement scraper config
DISCORD_ANNOUNCEMENTS_CHANNEL_ID=your_gate_announcement_channel_id
KEYWORDS=gate alpha, xstocks, launchpool          # ðŸ†• comma-separated keywords to filter Gate announcements

# Local cache file for preventing duplicate announcements
DISCORD_SESSION_PATH=./sent_links.txt

# Proxy settings for Selenium (optional)
USE_PROXY=true
PROXY_HOST=127.0.0.1
PROXY_PORT=7890

```

### How to get the credentials:

-   **Telegram:**
    -   `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`: Obtain these from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
    -   `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_IDS`: For public channels, you can use the channel's username (e.g., `@channel_name`). For private channels, you'll need the channel's numeric ID.
    -   `DESTINATION_TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`: This is the numeric ID of the Telegram group you want to forward messages to. You can get this by adding a bot like `@userinfobot` to your group and it will show the group's ID.

-   **Discord:**
    -   `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Create a new application and a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    -   `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`, `DISCORD_AIRDROP_CHANNEL_ID`, `DISCORD_TRADE_CHANNEL_ID`: In Discord, right-click on the channel and select "Copy Channel ID". You might need to enable Developer Mode in your Discord settings first (Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode).

## Usage

### Telegram-to-Discord Forwarder
Once the setup and configuration are complete, run the bot with the following command:

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will log in to both Telegram and Discord and start forwarding messages.

### Gate.io Announcements Scraper
```bash
python discord_gate_bot.py
```

### This will:

- Launch a headless Chrome browser via Selenium.

- Scrape the latest Gate.io announcements periodically (default every 5 minutes).

- Filter based on keywords.

- Send matched announcements to a Discord channel.

- Avoid duplicate posts using a local cache file.

- Run only during configured hours (default: 08:00â€“24:00).

### **Additional Notes**

- The Gate scraper uses Selenium with ChromeDriver. Make sure you have the correct version of ChromeDriver installed and available in your system PATH.

- Proxy usage can be disabled by setting USE_PROXY=false.

- ou can run both bots in parallel (e.g., in two separate terminal sessions or via tmux/supervisor).
